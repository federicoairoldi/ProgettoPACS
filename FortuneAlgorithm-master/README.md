# FortuneAlgorithm

A C++ implementation of the Fortune's algorithm for Voronoi diagram construction.

I wrote an [article](https://pvigier.github.io/2018/11/18/fortune-algorithm-details.html) about this project on my blog, feel free to read it!

You may be interested by [MyGAL](https://github.com/pvigier/MyGAL) which is the follow-up of this project. I turned it into a library and fix many edge cases making it way more robust.
